It was 2017, When I first learned about something called **Remote Work.** The idea of working from anywhere, anytime and the possibility of meeting new people and learning new things while doing so seemed so flourishing that I couldn't stop myself from applying to remote jobs. 

But there was a catch. Remote work wasn't that mainstream at that time plus Companies who were recruiting for such jobs did not have enough resources to go through every resume they receive from literally every corner of the world(with internet). So, it turned out in two ways: Either you won't get a reply back from the company or they will put some kind of restriction in job description that only people from specific geography can apply for the 'remote' job under consideration.

Because of all the 'buts' mentioned above, It was hard for me to search and apply at right companies. Luckily, I found [RemoteIndian ](https://remoteindian.com)around the same time. It is a wonderful community of Indian remote workers created and maintained by my friend [Abhishek Bose](https://twitter.com/abhishekbose87). After joining the community I got to know about lots of things, Like:

* Pros and Cons of working remotely
* Ideal work environment
* How to handle your finances

And many more. If you are working remotely from India(or want to) I would definitely suggest to give [RemoteIndian](https://remoteindian.com/guides) a look.

I also got to know that Abhishek was part of this hip remote work platform named **Toptal.** I thought of giving it a try and see how it goes. Fast forward two years, I have been part of Toptal for more than two years now. I get asked a lot about my interview experience at Toptal. So, I thought of gathering all my thoughts in this one post.

The thoughts that I have shared below is more for a QA appying to Toptal. But if you are someone who comes from a Development background, Feel free to check this amazing article from [Avi](https://dev.to/aviaryan/the-toptal-hiring-process-for-freelancers-27jp).

## Interview Process

Toptal's interview process consists of total 4 rounds. They can be categorized as below:

1. English Proficiency
2. Validating your Skills
3. Project
4. Retrospecting your choices

### English Proficiency

Once you are part of Toptal you will be working for clients from all over the world. Toptal expects people on their network to be proficient in English. This round gives them assurance that you will be able to understand client requirements and contribute back with best of your capabilities. Communication is also a very integral part of working Remote. So, you want to make sure you can fluently express your thoughts in English.

This round will be a 10-20 minutes call and someone from Toptal will be validating your English speaking skills.

### Validating your Skills

Toptal claims to cater **Top 3% of Freelance Talent**. So, it matters to them that you are best at what you do. This round will be 45-60 minutes of technical round. The discussions can range from your technical expertise in specific technologies to a coding test. 

#### Tips:

* Do some basic problem solving.

* Understand Software Test Life Cycle by heart

### Project

If you passed the technical round you will be given a project. You will be starting from scratch and covering everything. Like an Automation framework with CI/CD implementation. You will have one week's time to complete the project and submit it.

### Retrospecting your Choices

If you have made it this far.. you are most likely to get selected. In this round you will be most likely discussing the decisions you made while completing your week long projects. A lot of Hows and Whys. It can also cover some technical discussion related to the project you finished.

 So, that's about it. If you found this post helpful feel free to use this [link](https://topt.al/zdc75q) to register at Toptal. And I wish you **All the Best**.

It's OK if you don't get selected, It is not a big deal. Toptal gives you another chance to apply after a break of couple of months. Also, there are lots of other freelance platforms that you can apply. I have listed them below:

1. [Gigster](https://www.gigster.com/)
2. [Upstack ](https://upstack.co/)
3. [Flexiple](https://flexiple.com/)
4. [Arc](https://arc.dev/)
5. [Gun.io](https://www.gun.io/)

When I started searching for Remote Work in 2017, I never thought that there will be a global pandemic. Which will force everyone to go remote (partially or fully). But thinking optimistically it has introduced this wonderful form of working to a larger audience. And it is not going anywhere any time soon.
