I am not a Teacher



Most people say that I don't know anything. What can I teach.

Teaching is not something that we just learn at school. It is much more than that. 

When you hear about an apple - 10 people will imagine 10 different things.

When you see an apple - It is still possible that people have different ideas about what an apple is.



But when you taste an Apple and smell an apple than only can you really have the same understanding of what an apple is.



This is what we are trying to achieve at Cohort Pravritti. We are a community of cohorts.

Meet people who can help express the smell, taste, looks, shape, weight, and everything else of the new thing that you want to learn. Because we are all about learning and everyone has something to teach.



Like this post is an advertisement. If you have a proper look at the structure of this post you will understand that this is a long advertisement about Cohort learning. But don't let that discourage you. You should be able to understand what you are reading, listening and hearing then and only then can you really experience what you are getting into.
