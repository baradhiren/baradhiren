"Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that it's a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain."

- - -

the proximity of a desirable thing tempts one to overindulgence. On that path lies danger.

- - -

"O you who know what we suffer here, do not forget us in your prayers. "

- - -

Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in.

- - -

"Growth is limited by that necessity which is present in the least amount.
And, naturally, the least favourable condition controls the growth rate."

- - -

"There is no escape--we pay for the violence of our ancestors. "

- - -

There should be a science of discontent. People need hard times and oppression to develop psychic muscles.

- - -

"A time to keep and a time to cast away; a time for love and a time to hate; a time of war and a time of peace. "

- - -

'Be prepared to appreciate what you meet.'

- - -

Black is a blind remembering, she thought. You listen for pack sounds, for the cries of those who hunted your ancestors in a past so ancient only your most primitive cells remember. The ears see. The nostrils see.

- - -

My father once told me that respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality. "Something cannot emerge from nothing," he said. This is profound thinking if you understand how unstable "the truth" can be.

- - -

"The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door." And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course, warning "That path leads ever down into stagnation."

- - -

'Law is the ultimate science,' " Paul quoted. "Thus it reads above the Emperor's door. I propose to show him law."

- - -

"If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken."

- - -

> "Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past me I will turn to see fear's path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."

- - -

"What senses do we lack that we cannot see or hear another world all around us?"

- - -

'A stone is heavy and the sand is weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.'

- - -

"Whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and it has power,"

- - -

"The mind can go either direction under stress--toward positive or toward negative: on or off. Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive end. The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by training."

- - -

"Beginnings are such delicate times. "

- - -

The Fremen were supreme in that quality the ancients called "spannungsbogen"-- which is the self-imposed delay between desire for a thing and the act of reaching out to grasp that thing.

- - -

A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob."

- - -

"When your opponent fears you, then's the moment when you give the fear its own rein, give it the time to work on him. Let it become terror. The terrified man fights himself. 
Eventually, he attacks in desperation. That is the most dangerous moment, but the terrified man can be trusted usually to make a fatal mistake.

- - -

"May he guard it for the tribe, preserving it against careless loss. May he be generous with it in time of need. May he pass it on in his time for the good of the tribe."

- - -

The concept of progress acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future.

- - -

"It's easier to be terrified by an enemy you admire."

- - -

"Guilt starts as a feeling of failure,"

- - -

Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.

- - -

"The unknown brings its own worries," he said.

- - -

"Control the coinage and the courts -- let the rabble have the rest."

- - -

You cannot avoid the interplay of politics within an orthodox religion. This power struggle permeates the training, educating and disciplining of the orthodox community. Because of this pressure, the leaders of such a community inevitably must face that ultimate internal question: to succumb to complete opportunism as the price of maintaining their rule, or risk sacrificing themselves for the sake of the orthodox ethic.

- - -

When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself. You are always a little less than an individual.

- - -

How often it is that the angry man rages denial of what his inner self is telling him.

- - -

"My father had an instinct for his friends," Paul said. "He gave his love sparingly, but with never an error. His weakness lay in misunderstanding hatred.
human beings who share a love that he can never quite taste. It's a loss, an awakening to the fact that the world is there and here and we are in it alone. The moment carries its own truth; you can't evade it. I heard my father when he spoke of my mother. She's not the betrayer,

- - -

"Grief is the price of victory,"

- - -

But when you look inward and confront the raw force of your own life unshielded, you see your peril. You see that this could overwhelm you. The greatest peril to the Giver is the force that takes. The greatest peril to the Taker is the force that gives. It's as easy to be overwhelmed by giving as by taking."

- - -

Beyond a critical point within a finite space, freedom diminishes as numbers increase. This is as true of humans in the finite space of a planetary ecosystem as it is of gas molecules in a sealed flask. The human question is not how many can possibly survive within the system, but what kind of existence is possible for those who do survive.

- - -

the innocence with which he approached any problem. He was not naive, he merely permitted himself no distractions.

- - -

A system! A system maintains a certain fluid stability that can be destroyed by a misstep in just one niche. A system has order, a flowing from point to point. If something dams that flow, order collapses. The untrained might miss that collapse until it was too late. That's why the highest function of ecology is the understanding of consequences."
True religion must teach that life is filled with joys pleasing to the eye of God, that knowledge without action is empty. All men must see that the teaching of religion by rules and rote is largely a hoax. The proper teaching is recognized with ease. You can know it without fail because it awakens within you that sensation which tells you this is something you've always known."

- - -

"Whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and has powers of reality."

- - -

"Religion often partakes of the myth of progress that shields us from the terrors of an uncertain future."

- - -

"Kindness is the beginning of cruelty."

- - -

With such a tradition, suffering is accepted -- perhaps as unconscious punishment, but accepted. And it's well to note that Fremen ritual gives almost complete freedom from guilt feelings. This isn't necessarily because their law and religion were identical, making disobedience a sin. It's likely closer to the mark to say they cleansed themselves of guilt easily because their everyday existence required brutal judgments (often deadly) which in a softer land would burden men with unbearable guilt.

labelled "Kwisatz Haderach," a term signifying "one who can be many places at once." In simpler terms, what they sought was a human with mental powers permitting him to understand and use higher order dimensions.
