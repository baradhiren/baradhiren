I believe language to be one of the major reasons people feel constrained exposing themselves to new ideas. They don't read or explore because most of the content to deep dive in the content of their interest is not available in the languages they understand. 

So, In this article I wanted to share a nifty way to convert any article to your native language.

To follow this you will need a smart phone and Chrome browser installed.

1. On your Android phone or tablet, open the Chrome app.
2. Go to a web page written in another language.
3. At the bottom, select the language that you want to translate to.

   * To change the default language, tap More ![More](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oLoRPrHJd7m46sWijX6zBWnEnfslP62AxJSwt5Nj0bNbpaYHz2pyscExleiofsH2kQ=w36-h36 "More") ![and then](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SaY5lqCwN7kppnS546l9ys-E2sZftTTIHjBrdV-WsGPIhGjaxcEXjfgdIfW_UNG7Sw0=h36 "and then") **More languages** and select the language.
4. Chrome will translate the web page this once.

   * To always translate pages in this language, tap More ![More](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oLoRPrHJd7m46sWijX6zBWnEnfslP62AxJSwt5Nj0bNbpaYHz2pyscExleiofsH2kQ=w36-h36 "More") ![and then](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SaY5lqCwN7kppnS546l9ys-E2sZftTTIHjBrdV-WsGPIhGjaxcEXjfgdIfW_UNG7Sw0=h36 "and then") **Always translate pages in \[language]**.

You can achieve the same results on your laptop or desktop if you have Chrome browser installed. Refer to the [documentation from Google here](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/173424?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en-GB&oco=1).
