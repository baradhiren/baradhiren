Having studied at multiple boarding schools and then having worked in multiple cities of India, I have observed the impact of environment on your lifestyle. And I have always been fascinated by which personas my environment might bring forward from within me.

Now there are lots of parameters from my environment that affect specific aspects of my behaviour. But there is something about temples that irrespective of place, people, or weather they have always been able to provide me static, calm, and peaceful environment. And my theory is that it is the way it is because of the type of experience a temple provides.

\
We as humans interact with our environments through our senses. Our senses, which primarily consist of:

* Hearing 
* Smelling
* Seeing
* Touching
* Tasting

Now whenever you go into a temple all of your senses are covered to give you a specific "spiritual" experience. I am not going to go into the science of it as I am not that learned on the topic nor have I researched it into that much depth. But what I know is that it gives me an experience which is balanced, peaceful without any external influences. \
\
And I say that considering the sound of bells that I hear, the sweet Prasad that I taste, the calm idol of gods that I observe, or the overall natural being of a temple that I experience when I am in the presence of it. And this particular environment helps me be in a specific way. It helps me meditate and look inwards more easily. It allows me to be more empathetic towards my surroundings and helps me appreciate the world as it is.

Have you ever experienced something like this while being in a religious place?

What has your experience been like?\

Also, why do you think religions have these rituals to walk to specific places or have temples on top of mountains?\
Till now, I have found answers among following lines:

* In earlier times, Kings used to build their godess/god's temple on top of mountains to mark their territorry. (¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯)
* Walking has its own scientific benefits. Plus it helps you spend some time with yourself. So, while you go on these hardships you also give some time to yourself to think about your problems and that helps you find some closure?
* You climb a mountain and observe the vastness of the world. Now you feel elated to see something so big and want to praise that someone who might have built that amazing sunrise that you are observing and you build a temple?

What do you think?
