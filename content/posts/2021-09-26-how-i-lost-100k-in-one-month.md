It is 1:44 AM in the morning when I am writing this. Because I can't stop thinking about the number in the title. This is not just a click baity title but a cry for help and also my learnings from the experience.



India is a pretty diverse country but there is a dark side to religious, spiritual, and homely India. And my experience sadly relies on the darker side. This is a story of how a fraudster defrauded my father of 80,00,000Rs (~100K$) because of one mistake on our side.



The story starts with a proposition, This guy reaches out to my dad who has been searching for an opportunity to invest in a real estate. Who is the guy you ask? He was one of the local Dalal's in the area of Gir National Park. Think of Dalals as these real estate dealers (In our local lingo called "Dalal") who connects buyers and sellers and takes a cut from the total amount of deal money (Usually ~1%.) But apparently the land he pitched us was bit out of our budget, So he gave us an alternative. 

## The Proposition

There is a piece of land that the land owner wants to sell and he has another buyer ready to buy the land. But there is a big price difference in what land owner agreed on selling the land and what buyer agreed to buy in. So, he wanted my father to pitch in and buy the land with amount X and sell it to the buyer at amount Y.



## How it was going to go?

This is how the idea was pitched to us by the Dalal. We won't have to pay any money. And here is how the whole deal will follow:

1. Give a cheque to the seller and get document done

2. Get the document done with Buyer and get money from him

3. Give seller his part of money collect cheque from him and enjoy your piece of profit. (Simple)



## What plan?

Now this is where things started getting interesting. The seller who is also a farmer, Didn't trust cheques. So, he wanted to do the whole deal in cash. (ðŸš©). My father is a really sane guy in general (Saying it from the 26 years of experience I had with him) But the only thing which I got to know after becoming an adult was that how gullible the guy is. He believes them instantly and they saw their first opening. So, they come to our house and take 5,00,000 as initial token amount. Just to confirm things that we are going to buy the land. And with a discussion to pay another 45,00,000 to get the documents done from seller.



## Withdrawing Cash

India has a big problem with cash. And for the right reasons. That is why the current government implemented few laws to prevent people from withdrawing large sums of money. So, it was bit difficult for us to arrange such a large amount of cash. My father discussed this with a friend of his and he also agreed to take part in such a good "deal". They collect some money and gets documentation done. In a two week's time we paid them 50,00,000 to get notarized documents for all the land that was on sale.



Just a quick recap:

1. We were down 50,00,000 Rs where we didn't have pay a single penny.

2. We got notarized documents with seller saying he wants to sell this land at decided amount.



## Contacting Buyer

Real problem started in contacting the buyer. The dalal had mentioned that he lives in another city and it is bit touch to organize the meet with him. But he promised he will contact him and arrange a meet next week. Next week buyer comes and asks for the documents from registrar. But to get that done seller wanted another 30,00,000. 

My dad and his partner now already down 50,00,000 thought that even if the buyer backs out they can buy the land for themselves as they already wanted to invest any way. So, they gave them another 30,00,000 totaling to 80,00,000 Rs.



## Delays in Registrar documentation

After getting all of this money we hoped we will get the registrar documentation done during next week since that happened on Tuesdays and Wednesdays only. Now weeks starts to fly, it has already been 4 weeks and Dalal was saying that next week for sure they will accommodate the registrar documentation.

Because of all these delays we started researching a bit on the land and came to know following facts:

1. The land is allotted to the seller by Government of India to cultivate and earn some money from it.

2. He cannot sell this land to anyone since he does not own it. 



## Steps taken

1. We consulted one of our family lawyer on the matter and he suggested to get the money out if possible.

2. The legal system in india is crazy slow. So, if you get dragged into that it is just waste of time and money.



## Learning

1. Never do cash transactions.

2. If it looks like a fraud and sounds like a fraud it is a fraud.

3. Always check title and details of the land before buying it. (we only checked land records like form 7,12, and 8)



We are still looking for ways to recover the money. And we are not sure how to do this. Any help is really appreciated. I don't think the amount matters as much to me, I think I will be back on my feet in another 2-3 months. I just feel bad seeing my dad devastated from this whole experience. He is a gullible fellow but is true to his word and that is why wanted to pay back his friend's share of money.

This article is not just a cry for help but also a general warning when dealing with such people and investing in real estate. I am not sure how many other people might have gone through or going through such difficult things. And one of the worst thing about us Indians is that we always shy away to share our bad experiences while those are the ones we need to share so that we can help others. 



I also run an online community called Pravritti for rural india. While it is not to share such sob stories anyone who is interested in learning anything can join it. I believe every person has something to teach and based on that we want to connect mentors to their mentees.
