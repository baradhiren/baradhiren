### What is an SVG?

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation.
These are not my words. Credits go to the random person who updated SVG's wikipedia page.

W3C says:
SVG defines vector-based graphics in XML format.

In this post I will try to break it down into two parts and we will try to understand 
 - what SVGs really are and 
 - why they are so useful when it comes to rendering images on websites.

1. Vectore Based Graphics

2. XML

How SVGs are rendered
