1. Why local communities don't trust each other? (Ahir, Rabari, Muslims, Karadiya complex)

2. Why we only hear about corrupt leaders? (Can't we show people who did really good?) (Meet Sarpanch of Badalpara)

3. Introduce legal ways to do business. Sometimes not having exposure to knowledge might be the reason why people don't believe in filing taxes or giving money to the government. (Corruption has a bigger take on this though.)

4. Don't focus on politics but find ways to teach people how to open businesses and maintain them with legal ways.
